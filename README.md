# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for POST requests.  The example shows a POST route that's vulnerable to crashing or behaving unexpectedly if the request body is malformed or missing entirely.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The original code lacks error handling for situations where the request body (`req.body`) is missing or doesn't contain the expected data. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as silent failures or server crashes.  The current implementation merely logs the received data without any checks.

## Solution

The solution adds comprehensive checks to ensure the request body exists and contains the necessary data.  If the data is invalid, it returns an appropriate error response to the client, preventing unexpected behavior.  This makes the application more robust and reliable.
